100 Days of Code Journal:

Day 1: August 01, 2025

Today's Progress: Completed first challenge/assignment from my bootcamp code academy.

Thoughts: After completing this first assignment, I really understood how flexbox and grid work for layout design and is incredible helpful for doing this layout web design. I thought I should report this as Day 1 cause this is my very first time and assignment for design web and it really took me 5 days to design a simple website üòÖ. And of course it's always very hard for doing anything on the first time right?? üòÜüòÇ

Day 2: August 02, 2025

Today's Progress: Completed second challenge/assignment from my bootcamp code academy.

Thoughts: After completing this assignment, I start sharpening my skill to interpret design from figma and try to understand what kind of feature that is used on the design and start to implemented that feature on my code. I thought I should put report this as Day 2 cause this is part of my journey code and it took me 6 days for design that simple web üòÖ. And it's still hard because the difficulty of the assignments is increasing. üòÜüòÇ

Day 3: August 03, 2025

Today's Progress: Started learning the basics of Javascript.

Thoughts: After spending several days and hours learning HTML and CSS, I inititally thought they were programming languages. I was shocked to realize that they are not programming languages at all. HTML and CSS are just markup and styling languages, not programming languages. In my opinion, HTML and CSS are more like a framework or structure where programming languages are applied. Today, I spent several hours trying to understand the basic concepts of Javascript, which is one of the core programming languages for web development. It's been quite challenging since this is my first time studying it. However, I'm confident that if I continue learning, I will eventually become proficient in JavaScript and other languages needed for web development.

Day 4: August 04, 2025

Today's Progress: I created a simple math game for my lovely son.

Thoughts: I've been working on a simple math game, with some help from tools like ChatGPT, but I've continued to adjust the code to make it into the game I envision. Today, I focused on turning the simple web-based math game into a mobile app. I successfully made it a Progressive Web App (PWA), which works when the mobile device is connected to the internet. However, it still doesn't work offline. I want to improve it so the app can be accessed even without an internet connection. As of today, I haven't managed to turn it into a native app yet-but maybe tomorrow, or sometime soon, I'll give it another try.

Day 5: August 05, 2025

Today's progress: Began understanding and practicing JavaScript logic.

Thoughts: So. I was sitting there, and my head started feeling all hot, like I was about to explode! üòÇü§£ I've been really pushing myself to wrap my head around some basic JavaScript stuff. You know, just trying to practice with things like 'while', 'for', 'if', 'else', and 'else if. And oh man, I've had some hillarious moments trying to figure out loops like 'while' and 'for'. It's a bit wild, really, because if you mess up the code, you can end up in an infinite loop that just keeps going and going. Talk about a mind trip! I mean, that could totally overload your memory! Gotta be super careful with that!

Day 6: August 07, 2025

Thoughts: I would like to explain that my 100 Days of Code journal has been slightly delayed because I am currently on standby as my wife is about to give birth. Due to this situation, I haven't been able to stick to my usual coding routine. However, I'm still continuing my learning by practicing coding through mobile apps, which I can do from anywhere during this period.

Day 7: August 09, 2025

Today's progress: Try mastering if, else if and else again, and continue learning switch, case, and default.

Thoughts: I missed reporting this progress yesterday. So the yesterday's progress I updating to this day. I don't know why but I think should repeat about concept if, else if, and else, because there is any connection between switch, case, and default. And learn when to use if, and when to use switch case. Keep practicing and learn again and again until really understanding about that concept. Because I think it's important in the real conditions when I working on the project.

Day 8: August 10, 2025

Today's progress: Practiced and completed 6 challenges with nested loops and nested conditionals on JavaScript.

Thoughts: Oh my God...! I thought my head was going to explode while trying to solve and finish the challenges using nested loops and nested conditionals. After a few hours, little by little, I started to understand the concept and I was able to finish all 6 challenges, which involved creating 6 different forms with nested loops and conditionals. Oh yeeeaaaaahhhhh.....I feel energized!! 

Day 9: August 11, 2025

Today's progress: I Completed the third challenge/assignment from my bootcamp code academy.

Thoughts: 
I actually finished this assignment about three days ago, but I forgot to update my journal-so I'm doing it now. This is my third assignment, and as a learner, I think it's important to document my progress here.
This project was a whole new experience for me. It was built entirely with JavaScript-no HTML, no CSS-just 100% JavaScript, and it runs on the command line. At first, I was completely confused. The instructions didn't make much sense to me:
"A command-line challenge? What is that?"
"How can an application run without HTML and CSS? Is it possible?"
Those was my thoughts when I first saw the assignment. üòÇüòÅ
But day by day, I kept at it-breaking the challenge into smaller parts, learning as I went, and slowly things started to click. And in the end, I did it. I finished the assignment using nothing but JavaScript, and I'm really happy and proud myself for that.
"Keep fighting, stay strong, and stay motivated for myself."üí™üí™üí™

Day 10: August 12, 2025

Today's progress: Completed some practice video from Youtube.

Thoughts: I've recently completed several cases, practice exercises, and challenges from the video tutorials on YouTube. As I go through them, I'm updating this log to track my progress and reflect on what I've learned. It's been a great way to consolidate my understanding and improve my skills step by step.

Day 11: August 13, 2025

Today's progress: I spent some time going through coding practice and watching tutorial videos on Youtube. Got a few things done and learned a bit more today.

Thoughts: Lately,I'm starting to feel like learning to code has become part of my daily routine, almost like a basic need. Even though we now have all these advanced tools like AI, they don't really solve problems for us. They're just to help us solve problems ourselves. To actually make something work, we still need to understand the core concepts behind a programming language. Ai can give you answer, sure, but most of the time. you still need to adjust it, tweak it, and really understand what it's doing before it fits into your code properly. It's kind of reassuring, honestly. AI hasn't replaced us, it's just helping us learn and work more efficiently. And that's a good thing.

Day 12: August 15, 2025

Today's progress: Reinforcing the fundamentals of JavaScript.

Thoughts: So, the other day I had a discussion with my friends about a real project where we‚Äôre using JavaScript, and it got me thinking. I realized I need to switch up my approach to studying, especially when it comes to sharpening my skills and logic in JavaScript. That's why I've decided to go back to the basics‚Äîto really reinforce the fundamentals of my JavaScript knowledge.

Day 13: August 16, 2025

Today's progress: Days 2 Reinforcing the fundamentals of Javascript.

Thoughts: Today marks my second day of focusing on strengthening my JavaScript fundamentals. With a new study strategy in place, I can already feel my basics getting stronger. This feels really promising for the future, as I know that building a solid foundation now will pay off in the long run. It‚Äôs clear that investing time in mastering the fundamentals is key for long-term success in coding.

Day 14: August 17, 2025

Today's progress: Days 3 Reinforcing the fundamentals of Javascript.

Thoughts: Today, I spent some time revisiting the basics of JavaScript through live coding. I worked through about 30 problems topics like loops & conditionals. It felt like a good refresher since I‚Äôve been learning more advanced stuff recently, and going back to the fundamentals really helped me catch some small mistakes I had missed before. The live coding aspect was super helpful because I could test my solutions right away and debug as I went. It was a solid reminder that sometimes you need to revisit the basics to strengthen your understanding for the more complicated stuff ahead.

Day 15: August 19, 2025

Today's progress: Days 4 Reinforcing the fundamentals of Javascript.

Thoughts: Right now, I‚Äôm on full standby‚Äîmy wife is about to give birth any day now, and we‚Äôve been going back and forth to the maternity clinic quite a bit lately. It‚Äôs a rollercoaster of emotions: excitement, nervousness, anticipation‚Ä¶ all wrapped into one.
As a husband, being present and ready at all times is my top priority right now, which makes focusing on learning and coding practice pretty challenging. Concentration just doesn‚Äôt come as easily these days, with everything going on. Still, I try to carve out a few minutes here and there to squeeze in some JavaScript practice. It‚Äôs definitely not as much as I used to do before this ‚Äúbaby watch‚Äù phase started, but I‚Äôm doing what I can. A few exercises at a time‚Äîslow progress, but progress nonetheless. Life‚Äôs in a bit of a pause-and-go rhythm at the moment. But that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm learning to balance, breathe, and just ride the wave.

Day 16: August 20, 2025

Thoughts: Today, I couldn‚Äôt study JavaScript as well as I wanted. The reason? I was waiting at the clinic for my wife to give birth! It was such an intense and emotional day. Because I was mostly by her side, I didn‚Äôt have much time to dive deep into coding practice. Instead of doing hands-on programming, I only managed to review some theory by answering questions through a mobile app. It wasn‚Äôt the ideal way to study, but at least I kept my brain active and stayed connected to the material. Even though I didn‚Äôt get to write code today, I feel proud to support my wife during this big moment. Coding will wait; family comes first. Tomorrow, I hope to get back to proper practice with full focus.

Day 17: August 23, 2025

Today's progress: 1st day working on the 5th Assignment from my bootcamp academy.

Thoughts: So, for my 5th assignment in the Code Academy class, it‚Äôs a group project where we need to build a website together. The main focus of this task is to really hone our teamwork and collaboration skills using GitHub. I‚Äôve volunteered to take on a bigger chunk of the work, mainly because I want to improve my design slicing skills from Figma. I‚Äôm excited to dive in and practice more‚Äîlet‚Äôs make this project awesome!

Bring on the challenge! üöÄ

Day 18: August 24, 2025

Today's progress: 2nd day working on the 5th assignment from my bootcamp academy.

Wow, today was a big surprise! I didn‚Äôt expect it, but I managed to slice a lot faster than before. I remember it used to take me around 5 full days to slice just one landing page, but today, I was able to handle two pages in a single day. That‚Äôs amazing progress in my book! It really pumped me up and gave me even more motivation to keep learning and push towards becoming a front-end web development expert.

Feeling super excited about the journey ahead! üöÄ

Day 19: August 25, 2025

Today's progress: 3rd day working on the 5th assignment from my bootcamp academy.

Thoughts: Getting Comfortable with GitHub Collaboration. Today was an interesting day! I spent most of my time coding, but the focus was more on something that‚Äôs becoming super important in real-world development‚Äîcollaborating with GitHub. At first, I just knew GitHub as a place to store code, but today I really got into how it‚Äôs used in team projects. We‚Äôve all heard about version control, but actually using it to work together on a project is a whole different experience. There‚Äôs something satisfying about seeing all the different contributions, managing pull requests, and making sure everything‚Äôs in sync. It‚Äôs like working on a puzzle with a bunch of people, and every piece needs to fit perfectly. I‚Äôm starting to feel more comfortable navigating through GitHub, and I can already see how crucial it‚Äôs going to be when I dive into more complex, real-world industry projects. Whether it‚Äôs collaborating on code, reviewing each other‚Äôs work, or managing different versions, I can tell that mastering GitHub is key to getting things done efficiently. It‚Äôs definitely a step up from just coding on my own, but I can already tell that this kind of collaboration is going to be a huge part of my future work in the tech world.

Looking forward to diving deeper into this‚Äînext stop: mastering GitHub workflows!

Day 20: August 26, 2025

Today's progress: The Ticking Clock Before the Deadline

Thoughts: So, it's Day 4. The day before the big deadline for the simple website project that's been keeping me on my toes. It's been a rollercoaster, but I'm trying to stay focused and keep it all together. The task is to build a website based on a Figma design, turning those beautiful slices into clean HTML and styling them with Tailwind CSS. It sounds pretty straightforward, right? Well, it‚Äôs been anything but. I'm juggling my own part of the project while stepping in to help the team wrap up the tasks that aren‚Äôt quite finished. As the leader, I really need to make sure everything gets done and submitted on time. Some team members have struggled to complete their sections, whether it‚Äôs because of technical difficulties or lack of experience. Either way, I can‚Äôt let it affect the project. So, I‚Äôve had to take on extra work ‚Äî slicing through the pieces myself, tweaking the HTML and making sure the Tailwind framework is correctly applied. It‚Äôs a bit stressful, honestly, but I can‚Äôt afford to let anything slip. It‚Äôs all hands on deck at this point. We have to pull together to meet the deadline. The pressure is definitely on, but I‚Äôm hoping that all the hard work pays off tomorrow when everything is submitted on time. Here‚Äôs to making it through Day 5 ‚Äî and crossing the finish line.

Day 21: August 27, 2025

Today's progress: The Final Countdown

Thoughts: It‚Äôs Day 5, and we're down to the wire. Just a few hours left before the deadline, and honestly, it‚Äôs a relief to say that we‚Äôre almost there. The website, which was the main focus, has finally been sliced from Figma and converted into neat HTML with Tailwind CSS. I can't tell you how much of a weight that lifts off my shoulders. After some late-night tweaking, everything is looking solid ‚Äî responsive, functional, and pretty much exactly what we envisioned. It's a great feeling to know that we‚Äôve completed the bulk of the work. But, of course, there‚Äôs always a but. We‚Äôre not quite done yet. The next task at hand is preparing the presentation. We need to create a PowerPoint file that explains the entire process ‚Äî from the Figma design, the slicing, the HTML structure, and the magic of Tailwind. It‚Äôs a bit of a scramble right now, but I‚Äôm confident that we can pull it off. I‚Äôm gathering all the visuals, screenshots, and key points, trying to condense everything into a concise, professional, yet simple presentation. It‚Äôs not the biggest task, but it‚Äôs crucial for the submission. Plus, it‚Äôll be our chance to showcase the hard work and explain how we tackled the project. We‚Äôre so close. A few more hours of focus, and this will all be behind us. I just hope the final touches come together smoothly, and we can submit this with pride.
