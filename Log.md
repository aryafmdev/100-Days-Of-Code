100 Days of Code Journal:

Day 1: August 01, 2025

Today's Progress: Completed first challenge/assignment from my bootcamp code academy.

Thoughts: After completing this first assignment, I really understood how flexbox and grid work for layout design and is incredible helpful for doing this layout web design. I thought I should report this as Day 1 cause this is my very first time and assignment for design web and it really took me 5 days to design a simple website ðŸ˜…. And of course it's always very hard for doing anything on the first time right?? ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜‚

Day 2: August 02, 2025

Today's Progress: Completed second challenge/assignment from my bootcamp code academy.

Thoughts: After completing this assignment, I start sharpening my skill to interpret design from figma and try to understand what kind of feature that is used on the design and start to implemented that feature on my code. I thought I should put report this as Day 2 cause this is part of my journey code and it took me 6 days for design that simple web ðŸ˜…. And it's still hard because the difficulty of the assignments is increasing. ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜‚

Day 3: August 03, 2025

Today's Progress: Started learning the basics of Javascript.

Thoughts: After spending several days and hours learning HTML and CSS, I inititally thought they were programming languages. I was shocked to realize that they are not programming languages at all. HTML and CSS are just markup and styling languages, not programming languages. In my opinion, HTML and CSS are more like a framework or structure where programming languages are applied. Today, I spent several hours trying to understand the basic concepts of Javascript, which is one of the core programming languages for web development. It's been quite challenging since this is my first time studying it. However, I'm confident that if I continue learning, I will eventually become proficient in JavaScript and other languages needed for web development.
