100 Days of Code Journal:

Day 1: August 01, 2025

Today's Progress: Completed first challenge/assignment from my bootcamp code academy.

Thoughts: After completing this first assignment, I really understood how flexbox and grid work for layout design and is incredible helpful for doing this layout web design. I thought I should report this as Day 1 cause this is my very first time and assignment for design web and it really took me 5 days to design a simple website ðŸ˜…. And of course it's always very hard for doing anything on the first time right?? ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜‚

Day 2: August 02, 2025

Today's Progress: Completed second challenge/assignment from my bootcamp code academy.

Thoughts: After completing this assignment, I start sharpening my skill to interpret design from figma and try to understand what kind of feature that is used on the design and start to implemented that feature on my code. I thought I should put report this as Day 2 cause this is part of my journey code and it took me 6 days for design that simple web ðŸ˜…. And it's still hard because the difficulty of the assignments is increasing. ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜‚
