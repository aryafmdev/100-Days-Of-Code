100 Days of Code Journal:

Day 1: August 01, 2025

Today's Progress: Completed first challenge/assignment from my bootcamp code academy.

Thoughts: After completing this first assignment, I really understood how flexbox and grid work for layout design and is incredible helpful for doing this layout web design. I thought I should report this as Day 1 cause this is my very first time and assignment for design web and it really took me 5 days to design a simple website ðŸ˜…. And of course it's always very hard for doing anything on the first time right?? ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜‚

Day 2: August 02, 2025

Today's Progress: Completed second challenge/assignment from my bootcamp code academy.

Thoughts: After completing this assignment, I start sharpening my skill to interpret design from figma and try to understand what kind of feature that is used on the design and start to implemented that feature on my code. I thought I should put report this as Day 2 cause this is part of my journey code and it took me 6 days for design that simple web ðŸ˜…. And it's still hard because the difficulty of the assignments is increasing. ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜‚

Day 3: August 03, 2025

Today's Progress: Started learning the basics of Javascript.

Thoughts: After spending several days and hours learning HTML and CSS, I inititally thought they were programming languages. I was shocked to realize that they are not programming languages at all. HTML and CSS are just markup and styling languages, not programming languages. In my opinion, HTML and CSS are more like a framework or structure where programming languages are applied. Today, I spent several hours trying to understand the basic concepts of Javascript, which is one of the core programming languages for web development. It's been quite challenging since this is my first time studying it. However, I'm confident that if I continue learning, I will eventually become proficient in JavaScript and other languages needed for web development.

Day 4: August 04, 2025

Today's Progress: I created a simple math game for my lovely son.

Thoughts: I've been working on a simple math game, with some help from tools like ChatGPT, but I've continued to adjust the code to make it into the game I envision. Today, I focused on turning the simple web-based math game into a mobile app. I successfully made it a Progressive Web App (PWA), which works when the mobile device is connected to the internet. However, it still doesn't work offline. I want to improve it so the app can be accessed even without an internet connection. As of today, I haven't managed to turn it into a native app yet-but maybe tomorrow, or sometime soon, I'll give it another try.

Day 5: August 05, 2025

Today's progress: Began understanding and practicing JavaScript logic.

Thoughts: So. I was sitting there, and my head started feeling all hot, like I was about to explode! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ I've been really pushing myself to wrap my head around some basic JavaScript stuff. You know, just trying to practice with things like 'while', 'for', 'if', 'else', and 'else if. And oh man, I've had some hillarious moments trying to figure out loops like 'while' and 'for'. It's a bit wild, really, because if you mess up the code, you can end up in an infinite loop that just keeps going and going. Talk about a mind trip! I mean, that could totally overload your memory! Gotta be super careful with that!

Day 5: August 05, 2025

Thoughts: I would like to explain that my 100 Days of Code journal has been slightly delayed because I am currently on standby as my wife is about to give birth. Due to this situation, I haven't been able to stick to my usual coding routine. However, I'm still continuing my learning by practicing coding through mobile apps, which I can do from anywhere during this period.

Day 6: August 09, 2025

Today's progress: Try mastering if, else if and else again, and continue learning switch, case, and default.

Thoughts: I missed reporting this progress yesterday. So the yesterday's progress I updating to this day. I don't know why but I think should repeat about concept if, else if, and else, because there is any connection between switch, case, and default. And learn when to use if, and when to use switch case. Keep practicing and learn again and again until really understanding about that concept. Because I think it's important in the real conditions when I working on the project.
