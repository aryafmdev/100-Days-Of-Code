### ðŸ“… 100 Days of Code - My Journey to Master Full Stack & Python Development

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** repository!
This is a personal challenge where I commit to coding every day for 100 days, with the goal of honing my skills as a **Full Stack Developer** and **Python Developer**. Each day, Iâ€™ll tackle different projects, solve coding problems, and document my learning progress.

By following this challenge, I aim to:

* Build real-world applications using **Frontend & Backend technologies** (React, Node.js, Python, etc.)
* Deepen my understanding of **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **best coding practices**
* Learn new tools and technologies to stay on top of the ever-evolving software development landscape
* Cultivate a **strong growth mindset** and a **consistent daily coding habit**

### ðŸ“š What Youâ€™ll Find Here

* **Daily Updates**: A detailed log of what I worked on each day, including the challenges faced and the solutions I found.
* **Mini Projects**: Small projects and apps built using technologies like **React**, **Node.js**, **FastAPI**, **Flask**, and **Django**.
* **Coding Challenges**: Daily exercises and algorithm problems solved from platforms like **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, and **CodeWars**.
* **Resources**: Curated learning materials, tutorials, and links to useful articles or videos that helped me along the way.
* **Reflection**: Weekly reflections on what Iâ€™ve learned and how Iâ€™ve improved.

### ðŸš€ Why "100 Days of Code"?

The purpose of this challenge is to:

* **Build consistency**: Committing to code every single day, no matter how small, helps develop strong coding habits.
